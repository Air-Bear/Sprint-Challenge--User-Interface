1.If you were to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

Semantic HTML is simply using tags that are descriptive OF the element. For example, DIV doesn't tellus WHAT the element is beyond that... well it's a div SOMEWHERE on the page. So semantic html would be like a <header> tag. We know that a header is exactly what it says. It's located at the top of the page and is typically a small section containing a <nav> bar and maybe a small amount of information.

2.Name two big differences between display: block; and display: inline;. 

Display block forces the content to be on a seperate line. Which can be useful for isolating an element and making it stand out. Inline is just that, it's in the line. It can exist right next to other elements visually without any kind of visible, unless you want there to be, space or break.

3.What are the 4 areas of the box model? 

Margin, border, padding, content.

4.While using flexbox, what axis does the following property work on: align-items: center?

If it has the keyword "align" it probably works on the cross-axis.

5.Explain why git is valuable to a team of developers.

It allows you to go back to previous commits in case of new features implementing bugs. it also allows developers to quickly share files and compare solutions without having to send files individually to every person that wants to work on the project. There's a very simple online directory that everyone can simultaneously access, clone, and offer solutions to.
